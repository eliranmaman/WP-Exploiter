# WP-Exploiter
WP-Exploiter is a tool for testing and exploiting a wide range of WordPress websites. 

### Our tool coverage 
* Identifying WordPress websites by serval methods.
* Identifying a WordPress version by serval methods
* Enumerating WordPress users by serval methods.
* Detect & exploit weaknesses in specific versions.

###Requirements
* Python3 (tested on 3.7)
* Python modules as specified on requirments.txt

###Basic Usage
```bash
python cliy.py [COMMAND] [ARGS]
```
##### Possible commands - 
* detect - Detect if URL/IP is a WordPress site and try to get the WordPress system version. Args: 
    1. --url / -u: The URL/IP to test (for example: http://example.com)
    2. --timeout / -to: Maximum timeout for each HTTP request, in msecs and only integer (for example 100).
    3. --proxy / -p: Proxy (URL/IP) to use, (for example: 192.192.192.192).
* enumerate - Try to enumerate user names of WordPress System, Args:
    1. --url / -u: The URL/IP to test (for example: http://example.com)
    2. --proxy / -p: Proxy (URL/IP) to use, (for example: 192.192.192.192).
    3. minid: The id to start enumerate from (for example 1, will try enumerate user with id 1 and above).
    4. maxid: The user id to stop enumerate (for example 5, will try enumerate from the minid until id 5).
* bruteforce - Try to do login Bruteforce and crack passwords with a dictionary attack.
    1. --url / -u: The URL/IP to test (for example: http://example.com)
    2. --proxy / -p: Proxy (URL/IP) to use, (for example: 
    3. --usernames / -un: Path to a file containing user names to enumerates (each user name in a separate line).
    4. --passwords / -pass: Path to a file containing passwords to try for each username (each password in a separate line).
    5. --threads, -t: Number of working threads (default is 1, only integer).
* exploit - Try to exploit WordPress Website and gain control over the admin user.

    2. --proxy / -p: Proxy (URL/IP) to use, (for example: 
    3. --type / -ex: The exploite you wish to try, choose from [time-capsule, reset-database, all].
* readme - prints the readme file.

### Further Attacks
Of course, you can clone & implements other exploits. Our interface is generic and supporting serval exploiting methods.

### Automation
WP-Exploiter has the potential to be automated in different ways. This, we going to leave to you. 
As an example, you can find it at examples/run.py.
